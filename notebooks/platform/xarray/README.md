## Xarray Genetic Data API Prototype

This prototype library proposes a data model and API for genetic data.  This does not yet include implementations of any genetics methods.  Those implementations should be largely compatible with the [skallel](https://github.com/scikit-allel/skallel) framework, and this is intended as a starting point for a top-down design.

See [data_structures.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/related-sciences/gwas-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/platform/xarray/data_structures.ipynb) for example applications (NOTE: use the link to view on nbviewer -- it is hard to follow otherwise).
