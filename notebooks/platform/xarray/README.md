## Xarray Genetic Data API Prototype

This prototype library proposes a data model and API for genetic data.  This does not yet include implementations of any genetics methods.  Those implementations should be largely compatible with the [skallel](https://github.com/scikit-allel/skallel) framework, and this is intended as a starting point for a top-down design.

See [data_structures.ipynb](data_structures.ipynb) for example applications.
